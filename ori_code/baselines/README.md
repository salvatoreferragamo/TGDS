# Baselines

We list all the baselines we used for the convenience of reproduction and comparison.  We thank all the corresponding researchers open-source the codes for the reproduction.

Given that some baselines are currently not open-sourced, we have reproduced them based on our understanding. 

BERT-both/PGN-both: [https://github.com/xiaolinAndy/RODS]()

SDDS: [https://github.com/Hannibal046/SDDS]()

CONDIGSUM: [https://github.com/Junpliu/ConDigSum]()

SCL: we reproduce it in the folder of "./SCL"

(update later ...)

We also release the prompt, code we used in conducting experiments with LLMs and generated summaries together for reproduction. All described above could be found in the folder of "./LLM"
