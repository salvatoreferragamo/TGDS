# Data

In our paper, we conduct experiments on four datasets, which are **CSDS**, **IMCS-21**, **SAMSum** and **AMI**, separately.

We give the link for reserachers' who want to delve deeper into these datasets, we also upload these datasets for easy accessing.

**Thanks the contributions made by the following works:**

### CSDS

A new Chinese Customer Service Dialogue Summarization dataset.  In CSDS, each dialogue has three different types of summaries:

* **Overall summary** : The summary condensing the main information of the whole dialogue.
* **User summary** : The summary focusing on the user's main viewpoints.
* **Agent Summary** : The summary focusing on the agent's responses.

Besides, each summary are split into several segments, where each segment represent a single topic with its topic label.

### IMCS-21

This is a new corpus benchmark called IMCS-21 for automated medical consultation system. We mainly focus on the Medical Report Generation (**MRG**) task.

### SAMSum

The SAMSum dataset contains about 16k messenger-like conversations with summaries. Conversations were created and written down by linguists fluent in English. Linguists were asked to create conversations similar to those they write on a daily basis, reflecting the proportion of topics of their real-life messenger convesations

### AMI

We follow the code published in Github, which are used to preprocess AMI dataset for meeting summarization from scratch.
